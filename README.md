# Social-Media-Audit
Python Code and Data used for my social media Audit
If you wish to see the graphs, simply run the runner.py file in some IDE
Feel free to browse the code as you see fit!

What is what
main.py -> contains the 'DataStructure ' class which cleans the data, as well as contains the 'frequanText' method
Which makes a list of the number of times a word appears in the data
The Twitter Data.csv -> The Data as a csv file
runner.py -> the data that takes the clean data and makes the graphs
